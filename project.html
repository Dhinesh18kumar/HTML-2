    <h3> LED Distance Indicator using Arduino UNO </h3>

     <p>Ultrasonic sensors are great tools to measure distance and detect objects without any actual contact with the physical world. It is used in several applications, like in measuring liquid level, checking proximity and even more popularly in automobiles to assist in self-parking or anti-collision systems. Previously we have also build many Ultrasonic Sensor projects like water level detecting, Ultrasonic Radar etc. </p>
     <p>This is an efficient way to measure small distances precisely. In this project, we have used the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor with Arduino to determine the distance of an obstacle from the sensor. The basic principle of ultrasonic distance measurement is based on ECHO. When sound waves are transmitted in the environment then waves return back to the origin as ECHO after striking on the obstacle.</p>
     <p>So we only need to calculate the traveling time of both sounds means outgoing time and returning time to origin after striking on the obstacle. As the speed of the sound is known to us, after some calculation we can calculate the distance. We are going to use this same technique for this Arduino distance measurement project, so let's get started.  </p>
        <h3> Fire Alarm</h3>
    <p>The fire alarm project is designed for developing a temperature control system using thermistor. This simple fire alarm circuit using thermistor can be developed on your own over a solderless breadboard by following simple steps. Hence, it can be considered as a fire alarm mini project.</p>
